   <h1>Great Family Vacations!</h1>
   
   	   <article>Every year we used to drive up to Canada to go on vacation at the Fern Resort.  Along with my family, was 
       3 or 4 other families that were close friends of my parents.  We loved going every year, but eventually stopped when I was 14 or 15
       because everything gets old after awhile.  The trip became more  & more expensive.  However, I would definitely recommend this place
       to any family that has younger kids!
